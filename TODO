 This file contains list of tasks, which should be implemented.

 TODO
------
- UGS support must be defined by MSR (in bits per second).
- Implement radio channel support (so multiple SSes could be connected to one BS).
- Implement CDMA codes support.
- Implement best effort.
- Make connections (in SS as well as BS) configurable.


 Implemented/Not tested
