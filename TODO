 TODO
------
- Radio channel support, so multiple SSes could be connected to one BS (Andrzej)
- Switching between BSes (Andrzej)
- Implement best effort.
  - Implement CDMA codes support.
  - Implement Bandwidth Request support. (Maciek)
- Make connections (in SS as well as BS) configurable.
- WMaxCtrl: Implement network entry
- WMaxCtrl: Implement service flow creation (DSA-REQ, DSA-RSP, DSA-ACK)
- WMaxCtrl: Implement scanning

 Implemented/Not tested
------------------------
- WMaxCtrl: Implement handover (thomson)
- UGS throughput is now defined by MSR (in bits per second).

 BUGS
------
- After handover, connections are created using DSA (connection information is 
  transferred to target BS, so there is no need to recreate connections)
