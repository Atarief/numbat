This version depends on 

- 802.1Q VLANs for the CS sub-layer 
- PON for CopyableQueues, per flow statistics

Both can be found at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/omneteponmodule/

Installation:
- Download
- Extract the archive 
- Import the Vlans project into your workspace
- Import the PON project into your workspace
- Clean it and re-compile it

... it should work. Separate link will be provided in the future (only for the VLANs)
