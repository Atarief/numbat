== INTRO ==

This is a first try to integrate OMNet++ INET/MANET framework with numbat. The 
general idea is that the BS bridge the WiMax network with an Ethernet network.
VLANs are used in order to map WiMax services to Ethernet.


== INSTALLATION == 

This version depends on 

- 802.1Q VLANs for the CS sub-layer 
- PON for CopyableQueues, per flow statistics

Both can be found at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/omneteponmodule/

Installation:
- Download
- Extract the archive 
- Import the Vlans project into your workspace
- Import the PON project into your workspace
- Setup the dependencies (Project References)
- Clean it and re-compile it

... it should work. Separate link will be provided in the future (only for the VLANs)

== USAGE ==

The main models provided from this release can be found under the <proj>/src/wimax/models. 
These include the above described VlanBS, a generic WiMax Interface which can be used in 
other modules and an example host using the WiMax interface and TCP/IP stack of the INET.
